### Virtuoso mastery of the Bhop skill in CS 2 has become one of the most popular ways of movement among players. Today we will publish a simple External Bhop cheat that allows the player to do bhop in automatic mode by holding down only one Space bar. Bhop is an abbreviation of the words "Bunny Hop", which can be translated as "rabbit jump". This cheat allows the player to perform jumps without losing speed. This is a completely external cheat, so you will not get a VAC ban for using it, as well as a red trust factor.

> [!TIP]
> ### I emphasize that our software has been tested, and you are guaranteed not to be banned!
